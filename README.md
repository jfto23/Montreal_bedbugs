## About

The website uses Montreal's [open
data](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/declarations-exterminations-punaises-de-lit) to show where exterminations of bedbugs occured.
As stated on Montreal's site, the data is not verfied by the city and is
declared by the exterminators themselves. Therefore, the data
may not be completely accurate.
